# Concepts

Convergence
:	"the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want." [@Jenkins2006ccw, p. 2]
"black box fallacy"
:	the fallacy that we will only have a single black box.
collective intelligence (also "transmedia storytelling" and "affective economics")
:	large scale collaboration leveraging constituent expertise.
participatory culture
:	fans are invited to participate

# Go around

Sometimes we focus on themes, but often we do a "go around" in which everyone has an opportunity to discuss. This might prompt a discussion/thread, and then we resume. If you had your say during an earlier thread, just say so when I come to you.

# Questions

# Where does convergence happen?

> Convergence does not occur through media appliances, however sophisticated they become. Convergence occurs within the brains of individual consumers and through their social interactions with others. [@Jenkins2006ccw, p. 3]

> convergence refers to a process, not an end point. There will be no single black box that controls the flow of media into our homes. [@Jenkins2006ccw, pp. 14-15]

# What does Lisa Gitelman say about the two levels of media?

A medium is a technology that enables communication; it is also a set of associated protocols or social cultural practices; delivery systems are technology, media are cultural systems [@Jenkins2006ccw, p. 13]

# How did it come to be?

> Digitization set the conditions for convergence; corporate conglomerates created it imperative. [@Jenkins2006ccw, p. 11]

# Is convergence top-down corporate-driven and bottom-up consumer-driven?

Both. [@Jenkins2006ccw, p. 18]
