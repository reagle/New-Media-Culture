# Introduction

Extending our consideration of MP3s as cultural artifacts, today we will look at some other forms of related cultural production from online communities.

# Music subcultures

# Is dancing copyrightable?

Choreographic works have been expressly copyrightable since 1978.  Many choreographers register their works but few infringement cases have reached the Federal courts. [@VanCamp1994ccw]

> The term Long Tail has gained popularity in recent times as describing the retailing strategy of selling a large number of unique items with relatively small quantities sold of each – usually in addition to selling fewer popular items in large quantities.  [@Wikipedia2011lt]

# Is this convergence culture?

1. media convergence
2. participatory culture (fans are invited to participate in creation and circulation of content)
3. and collective intelligence (the sum total of information held individually and accessible by the group)

# Is it evidence of memes?

1. variation
2. heredity/replication

# Go Around

# What are other ways in which new media contributes to participatory culture?

# [Vocoder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocoder)

> ... the signal is split into a number of frequency bands (the larger this number, the more accurate the analysis) and the level of signal present at each frequency band gives the instantaneous representation of the spectral energy content. Thus, the vocoder dramatically reduces the amount of information needed to store speech, from a complete recording to a series of numbers. 

> To recreate speech, the vocoder simply reverses the process, processing a broadband noise source by passing it through a stage that filters the frequency content based on the originally recorded series of numbers.

# What is the "HATSUNE MIKU movement"?

> "HATSUNE MIKU" is computer music software that enables users to create synthesized singing of unprecedented quality and remarkable realism by just typing in lyrics and melody. Powered by YAMAHA's VOCALOID(= Vocal + Android) technology, HATSUNE MIKU was developed by Crypton Future Media, Inc. in Sapporo, Japan, and released on August 31st, 2007. Since then, there have been more than 100,000 songs and movies about HATSUNE MIKU posted on popular video sharing websites such as YouTube and Nico-Nico-Douga (Japan). -[Crypton](http://www.crypton.co.jp/mp/pages/prod/vocaloid/cv01_us.jsp)

# Is there a new aesthetic?

> Largely brought together online, this tangle of diverse street-level sounds is bound by common experience and shared reference points. Its accelerated interactive pace is driven by the proliferation of accessible music and video-production software, and the connective possibilities of the social web - the key feature of which is the explosion of networked platforms that enable anyone with access to publish their music and dance moves to a limitless audience. [@Marshall2010sww, p. 2]

# Cracked and demoware

The use of cracked or demo software produces "a patina of piracy, and unintentional but marked aesthetic effect that privileges participation, immersion and immediacy. [@Marshall2010sww, p. 2]

# Group: Come up with "fair use" policy

What are some criteria that you would recommend to permit for the derivation of copyrighted works?

# 17 U.S.C. § 107

In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:

1. the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
2. the nature of the copyrighted work;
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
