# Introduction

In the last class we went back to some of the deep history of net culture roots. Today we consider two timelines of more recent social network history beginning in the 90s.

While Facebook certainly dominates our attention today, there have been many social networks -- leading to Shirky's YASNS (Yet Another Social Network Site). Many of these have fallen by the wayside, which prompts interesting questions.

# Concepts

# Social Network Site v. Networking

>  social network sites: ... web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system. [@BoydEllison2007sns, s. 2]

"networking" is not useful because it emphasizes relationship initiation; rather what is important is not meet strangers but making visible one's social networks. [@BoydEllison2007sns, s. 2]

# Network effect (e.g., fax machine)

> In economics and business, a network effect ... is the effect that one user of a good or service has on the value of that product to other people. When network effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it. [@Wikipedia2011ne]

# Preferential attachment (rich get richer)

> A preferential attachment process is [when] some quantity, typically some form of wealth or credit, is distributed among a number of individuals or objects according to how much they already have, so that those who are already wealthy receive more than those who are not. [@Wikipedia2011pa]

# First-mover advantage (the hare beat the tortoise -- sometimes)

> In marketing, first-mover advantage or FMA is the advantage gained by the initial ("first-moving") significant occupant of a market segment. ... This advantage may stem from the fact that the first entrant can gain control of resources that followers may not be able to match. Sometimes the first mover is not able to capitalize on its advantage, leaving the opportunity for another firm to gain second-mover advantage. [@Wikipedia2011fma]

# Bandwagon effect (psychological)

> The bandwagon effect ... is a phenomenon—observed primarily within the fields of microeconomics, political science, and behaviorism—that people often do and believe things merely because many other people do and believe the same things. The effect is often called herd instinct, though strictly speaking, this effect is not a result of herd instinct. [@Wikipedia2011be]

# Switching costs (lock in)

Switching costs are the costs associated with changing a dependency. Traditionally it is associated with the change of suppliers but can also apply to social networking sites or document formats (e.g., .doc files).

# Exercise: Features/variables of SNS

Break into groups of four and come up with a matrix of variables for describing a SNS.

> * topic (e.g., dating, music, college friends)
> * seeding/scale (e.g., what community it serves, how it grows)
> * customization of profile
> * authenticity of profile
> * distance of browsing (e.g., 4 degrees; G+ circles)
> * degree of interactivity
> * media 
> * cross-site integration
> * type of relationship/directionality (e.g., work, family, friend, aquaintance)

# What causes an SNS to fail/decline?

Friendster had:

> * technical difficulties
> * social collisions (over deletion of Fakester accounts)
> * and a rupture of trust between users and the site (boyd, 2006b).
> * (Yet, it was doing great in South Asia)

What else?

# Excercise: Life-cycle

Break into groups and describe the life-cycle and features of a fictitious SNS, using the effects and variables we discussed.

# Review of Concepts

* Network effect (e.g., fax machine)
* Preferential attachment (rich get richer)
* First-mover advantage (the hare beat the tortoise -- sometimes)
* Bandwagon effect (psychological)
* Switching costs (lock in)
