% Net Culture and Counter Culture
% Joseph Reagle

# Introduction

At the heart of much net culture is the juxtaposition of two idealogies: countercultural communalism and libertarianism. 

Richard Barb Brooke and Andy Kemmerer in 1998 identified Wired's particular "blend of libertarian politics, countercultural aesthetics, and techno-utopian visions 'Californian Ideology'." [@Turner2006fcc, p. 208]

Today, we will be looking at the countercultural roots of net culture with a concern for freedom and communalism.

> Thus, the back-to-the-landers of the New Communalist movement simultaneously turned their backs on the militarized bureaucracy of the state and embraced systems theory, the techno-centric orientation, the emphasis on mind, and the collaborative, experimental sociability that had grown up within it. [@Turner2006fcc, p. 245]

(We will not look at the libertarianism until much later in the semester.)

We will also encounter some concepts that speak to the synchronicity in cultural trends, and look at their flow and overlaps.
