# Introduction

For the most part we've been speaking of mostly benign online communities and cultures. 

Today we will begin looking at a different facet of online culture and online personalities.

# Trolls

> *  someone who intentionally disrupts online communities. [@Schwartz2008tau, sec. 2]

# Flaming

> Flaming, also known as bashing, is hostile and insulting interaction between Internet users. [@Wikipedia2011fi]

> Deliberate flaming, as opposed to flaming as a result of emotional discussions, is carried out by individuals known as flamers, who are specifically motivated to incite flaming. These users specialize in flaming and target specific aspects of a controversial conversation, and are usually more subtle than their counterparts. Their counterparts are known as trolls who are less "professional" and write obvious and blunt remarks to incite a flame war, as opposed to the more subtle, yet precise flamers. [@Wikipedia2011fi]

# Lulz

> * “Lulz” is how trolls keep score. A corruption of “LOL” or “laugh out loud,” “lulz” means the joy of disrupting another’s emotional equilibrium. [@Schwartz2008tau, sec. 2]

# Griefers

> * a griefer is an online version of the spoilsport -- someone who takes pleasure in shattering the world of play itself.... It's just that what they most enjoy about those games is making other players not enjoy them. [@Dibbell2008mff, sec. 2]

# Is this the result of antisocial personalities, or a group/cultural phenomena? 

# Is this a case of convergence culture?

1. media convergence
2. participatory culture (fans are invited to participate in creation and circulation of content)
3. and collective intelligence (the sum total of information held individually and accessible by the group)


# Group: create 4 multiple choice questions that distinguish between:

* hacktivism
* culture jamming
* trolling
* griefing

# Does this justify the awful behavior?

> Kyanka went on to review the long and bloodless history of death threats among Internet commenters, then revealed his own impressive credentials as a target: "I've been getting death threats for years now. I'm the king of online dying," [@Dibbell2008mff, sec. 5]

# What are possible responses?

> * disemvoweling;
> * reputation systems;
> * ...

## Define the problem and where you might draw the line.

* No problem?
* Good but edgy fun?
* A consequence of free speech?
* Harassment?
* Stalking?

## Make a few recommendations to legislators
